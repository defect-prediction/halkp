</a>Description</h2>
As defects in software modules may cause product
failure and financial loss, it is critical to utilize defect prediction
methods to effectively identify the potentially defective modules
for a thorough inspection, especially in the early stage of software
development lifecycle. For an upcoming version of a software
project, it is practical to employ the historical labeled defect
data of the prior versions within the same project to conduct
defect prediction on the current version, i.e., Cross-Version
Defect Prediction (CVDP). However, software development is
a dynamic evolution process that may cause the data distribution
(such as defect characteristics) to vary across versions.
Furthermore, the raw features usually may not well reveal the
intrinsic structure information behind the data. Therefore, it
is challenging to perform effective CVDP. In this paper, we
propose a two-phase CVDP framework that combines Hybrid
Active Learning and Kernel PCA (HALKP) to address these two
issues. In the first stage, HALKP uses a hybrid active learning
method to select some informative and representative unlabeled
modules from the current version for querying their labels, then
merges them into the labeled modules of the prior version to
form an enhanced training set. In the second stage, HALKP
employs a non-linear mapping method, kernel PCA, to extract
representative features by embedding the original data of two
versions into a high-dimension space. We evaluate the HALKP
framework on 31 versions of 10 projects with three prevalent
performance indicators. The experimental results indicate that
HALKP achieves encouraging results with average F-measure,
g-mean and Balance of 0.480, 0.592 and 0.580, respectively and
significantly outperforms nearly all baseline methods.
